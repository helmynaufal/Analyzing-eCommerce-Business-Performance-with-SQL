# Analyzing eCommerce Business Performance with SQL
In this report, I will analyze the business performance of an e-Commerce company, considering several business metrics, customer growth, product quality, and payment types. I use Postgresql to analyze the data.

I create this project through several steps:
## 1. Data Preparation
First, I create a database and the table in Postgresql and then import the dataset. Next, I made the entity relationship between tables and then generated the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## 2. Analyze Annual Customer Activity Growth
I show some data to analyze:
- Average Monthly Active User
- Total new customer
- Total customer who made repeat orders
- Average number of orders

## 3. Analyze Annual Product Category Quality
I show some data to analyze:
- Highest revenue category
- Total revenue
- Most canceled category
- Total canceled orders

## 4. Analyze Annual Payment Type Usage
Here I showed detailed information on the payment type used for each year.
